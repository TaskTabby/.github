## 👋😸 Welcome

If you have stumbled here, you are most likely interested in getting started with TaskTabby. Before you embark on your journey, we recommend reading a bit about us!

## Who are we?

We are a small group of people with all sorts of backgrounds. We have one core thing in common: striving to stay organized (and love for cats). We refer to ourselves as The TaskTabby Team and are responsible for the basis of the app. We also encourage any pull requests if you want to give us a helping hand (or paw). 

## Open Source
We plan to make as much of Task Tabby open source. There are a few minor exceptions, such as the authentication server due to well, security.

## Our goals

We have a few goals in mind for developing TaskTabby:
- 😸 Make productivity fun and less stressful 
- 🙏 Encourage collaboration: working with (and against) friends to achieve more
- ❤️ Create a free and welcoming environment; we are not in it for the money!
- 😮 Make productivity satisfying with virtual awards to raise your own virtual cats!

## How it works

The app consists of different productivity activities and utilities, and good productivity comes with good, well... goodies. You can use the money you earn to raise your own fleet of virtual cats! Also, enabling our browser addon will automatically put entertainment sites on "lockdown" when you have enabled "Focus Mode" in the app.
